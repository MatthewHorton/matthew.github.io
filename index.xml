      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Matt!
I&amp;rsquo;m just a geek that loves to tinker. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in an out of Linux for just about all of this century. Technically, I started with FreeBSD 3.2 after I got the discs from some old hacker show in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s. After that it was Slackware, LFS with a LUG, Gentoo, Arch, and now Fedora. I&amp;rsquo;ve used quite a few others, but these were my main distros.</description>

      <description>Dunno. Hi?
Ok. Ok ok ok. Took some googling, but I got this.
Installed snapd on Fedora in order to install Hugo extended. This allowed me to use the themes that I really liked.
Then I had to clean up my git modules because I kept getting an error about public being in use.
After that, I edited the deploy.sh script that I got from the official documentation. It was using https, and I changed it to use ssh.</description>
