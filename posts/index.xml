			<description>Dunno. Hi?
Ok. Ok ok ok. Took some googling, but I got this.
Installed snapd on Fedora in order to install Hugo extended. This allowed me to use the themes that I really liked.
Then I had to clean up my git modules because I kept getting an error about public being in use.
After that, I edited the deploy.sh script that I got from the official documentation. It was using https, and I changed it to use ssh.</description>
